The 'incremental' test will most likely not succeeed, because the incremental
dump is unable to determine file modifications. Thus, the file dir1/file2
will be dumped with all its content, just to be sure there's no modification
missing. 
The test will apply a binary patch using the 'bspatch' utility, which is part
of the 'bsidff' programs ( http://www.daemonology.net/bsdiff/ ). If the
utility is not present on your system, the test will fail and the resulting
diff in logs/ will look like this:
