h1. A tool to convert a subversion dump for input to git-fast-import

This project is currently in its infancy - just the building blocks for the data-structures needed for good time and memory bounds. The inspiration comes from both git2svn.py and svn-all-fast-export. It will eventually combine some functions of both projects but hopefully with a small codebase with few dependencies.
